PRESENTATION SCRIPT: Gateway Server Files
================================================================================

HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT DIFFERENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML = Structure (skeleton) - defines WHAT content appears
  Think: The bones of a webpage - where text, buttons, and images go

CSS = Styling (appearance) - defines HOW things look
  Think: The paint and decorations - colors, sizes, fonts, spacing

JavaScript = Behavior (brain) - defines WHAT HAPPENS when users interact
  Think: The smart systems - makes buttons work, fetches data, updates the page

Analogy: HTML = house structure, CSS = paint/decorations, JS = electricity/smart systems

FILE STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. index.html
Purpose: Main dashboard page structure
- 2x2 quadrant layout (Map, Humidity, Temperature, CO2)
- Navigation bar, hero section, facility map
- Links to style.css and script.js
  (Links = tells browser to also load those files)
Example: <div class="sensor-card"><h2>Temperature</h2></div>

2. script.js
Purpose: Interactive logic and data fetching
- Fetches data from Open-Meteo API every 3 seconds
  (API = Application Programming Interface - like a website that gives you data)
  (Fetches = goes to the internet and asks for information)
- Updates charts and sensor values automatically
- Handles facility map interactions (clicking, hovering)
Example: async function getSensorData() { fetch(apiUrl)... }
  (async function = a function that can wait for internet requests to finish)

3. style.css
Purpose: Visual design and layout
- Color scheme (mint #ADEEE3, teal #86DEB7)
  (#ADEEE3 = a color code, like a paint color number)
- 2x2 grid layout, unified card styling
  (Grid = like a table with 2 rows and 2 columns)
- Responsive design
  (Responsive = automatically adjusts for phone/tablet screens)
Example: .dashboard-grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }
  (This creates a 2-column grid where each column takes equal space)

4. about.html
Purpose: Team information page
- TU/e team introduction, mission statement
- System diagram image
- Technical specifications

5. contact.html
Purpose: Contact form page
- Form fields: Name, Email, Organization, Phone, Message
- Validation (checks if email is valid format, if required fields are filled)
- Consistent styling (looks the same as other pages)

6. index.js
Purpose: Express.js backend server
  (Backend = the part that runs on the server, not in your browser)
  (Express.js = a tool that makes it easy to create a web server)
  
- POST /ingest: Receives sensor data from ESP32
  (POST = a way to send data TO the server, like submitting a form)
  (ESP32 = our sensor device that measures temperature, humidity, CO2)
  (/ingest = the address/URL where data gets sent, like a mailbox)
  
- GET /events: SSE stream for real-time updates
  (GET = a way to REQUEST data FROM the server, like asking for information)
  (SSE stream = Server-Sent Events - like a live TV channel that keeps sending 
   new data automatically. Instead of refreshing the page, new sensor readings 
   just appear automatically. Think of it like a live sports score that updates 
   on your phone without you clicking refresh.)
  
- Serves all static files
  (Serves = sends files to your browser when you request them)
  (Static files = files that don't change, like HTML, CSS, images - opposite of 
   dynamic content that's generated on the fly. Like serving a photo vs taking 
   a new photo each time.)
  
Example: app.post("/ingest", (req, res) => { ... })
  (This code says: "When someone sends data to /ingest, do something with it")

7. package.json
Purpose: npm configuration
  (npm = Node Package Manager - like an app store for code libraries)
  (Configuration = settings that tell the computer what to do)
- Dependencies: express, cors
  (Dependencies = code libraries we need, like express for the server and cors 
   for allowing cross-origin requests. CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - 
   allows our webpage to talk to servers on different websites. Without it, 
   browsers block requests for security reasons.)
- Script: "npm start" runs server
  (Script = a command you type to start the program)

8. template/esp-status-dashboard.html
Purpose: Standalone template file for the facility map visualization
  (Template = a starting point or example that we copied from)
  (Standalone = works by itself, doesn't need other files)
  
- Self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
  (Embedded = the CSS and JavaScript code is written directly inside the HTML file,
   instead of being in separate files. Like having everything in one document.)
  
- Interactive facility map showing ESP sensor locations
  (Interactive = you can click and hover on things)
  (ESP sensors = our temperature/humidity/CO2 measuring devices)
  
- Features: Level switching (Level 1, 2, 3), sensor status (online/offline), 
  relative distance calculations
  (Relative distance = how far sensors are from each other, like "Sensor A is 
   5 meters from Sensor B")
  
- We copied this code into our main index.html
  (We took the good parts from this template and integrated them into our 
   dashboard, so now the facility map is part of the main page)

HOW IT WORKS TOGETHER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Browser loads index.html (structure)
   (Browser = Chrome, Firefox, Edge - the program you use to view websites)

2. Browser applies style.css (styling)
   (Applies = uses the CSS rules to make things look pretty)

3. Browser executes script.js (behavior)
   (Executes = runs the code, makes things interactive)

4. script.js fetches data every 3 seconds and updates HTML
   (Updates = changes the numbers and graphs on the page automatically)

5. index.js serves files and receives ESP32 sensor data
   (Receives = gets data sent from the sensors)

6. All pages share same CSS for consistency
   (Consistency = everything looks the same, professional)

SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 3 HTML files (structure): index.html, about.html, contact.html
- 1 CSS file (styling): style.css
- 2 JS files (behavior): script.js (frontend), index.js (backend)
  (Frontend = runs in your browser, Backend = runs on the server)
- 1 config file: package.json
